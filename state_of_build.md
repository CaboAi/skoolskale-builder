# State of Build — SkoolSkale Community Builder

**Snapshot date:** 2026-05-21 (post `chore/remove-image-generation`)
**Live URL:** https://skoolskale-builder.vercel.app
**Latest production deployment:** _to be updated after this PR merges_

> **Major change in this snapshot:** AI image generation removed entirely.
> The builder is now a pure copy generator. VAs handle community visuals
> (cover, icon, classroom cover, calendar cover) externally in Canva using
> the client's professional photography. See CHANGELOG for the full cut.

## What works end-to-end today

A VA can:

1. **Sign in** via the demo-mode auto-session (see Open Items #1).
2. **Create a creator profile** with intake form (`/creators/new`).
3. **Spin up a launch package** (`POST /api/packages` → `POST /api/packages/[id]/generate`).
4. **Watch all 9 text modules generate in parallel** via Inngest + the package detail page polling:
   - `welcome_dm` (Claude Sonnet 4.6)
   - `transformation` (Claude)
   - `about_us` (Claude)
   - `start_here` (Claude)
   - `classroom` — title + description per VA-supplied title (Claude)
   - `calendar` — title + description per event (Claude)
   - `leaderboard` — 9 level names (Claude)
   - `categories` — 3 named blocks (Claude)
   - `discovery_seo` — 11 search keywords (Claude)
5. **Edit, regenerate, or approve** each module from the dashboard.
6. **Hit the export page** and copy/paste-ready outputs for Skool deployment.

Package wall-clock is now bounded by the slowest Claude call (typically 5-15s) rather than by Gemini's 30-90s variant generation. Expected total wall-clock: **20-45s** for a 9-module package.

## Open items / Known issues

### 1. Demo-mode auth bypass is still on (HIGH)
Demo-mode auto-signs anyone hitting the URL as the demo user. Gate by env / flip off before any non-demo audience.

### 2. GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY still in Vercel env vars (LOW — manual cleanup)
The Gemini integration is gone but the sensitive env var lives until Mario removes it via `vercel env rm GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`. Vercel's UI can't widen or delete sensitive env vars.

### 3. Legacy image storage buckets still provisioned (LOW — ops decision)
`cover-variants` and `image-variants` Supabase buckets remain in place to keep historical cover URLs in deployed Skool communities resolvable. Removal of the buckets (and the orphaned `generated_assets` rows with `module='cover'/'icon'/'classroom_cover'/'calendar_cover'`) is a separate ops decision once the legacy URLs are confirmed retired.

### 4. Test suite is flaky in parallel mode (LOW)
Per CLAUDE.md "Mocking conventions": closure-captured state inside `vi.mock` factories leaks across parallel workers and surfaces as timeouts in unrelated test files. Different test fails each full-suite run, all pass in isolation. CI should run with `--no-file-parallelism` until that's debugged.

### 5. No Canva integration yet
Future sprint.

### 6. No pattern library admin UI yet
Future sprint.

## Build scope status

| Scope | Status |
|---|---|
| Foundation + Copy Engine | **✅ Shipped** (9 text modules, dashboard, intake step 5) |
| Canva Integration | **❌ Not started** |
| Pattern Library Intelligence | **❌ Not started** (read-only fetch from DB exists) |

> The "Visual Engine" scope from earlier snapshots is **DEAD** — image generation removed in chore/remove-image-generation. VAs use Canva for all visuals.
